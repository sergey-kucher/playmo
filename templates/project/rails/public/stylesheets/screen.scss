// Here's where we define some default constants
@import "partials/constants";

// Then we'll import the compass extension
@import "html5-boilerplate";

// Now, you can simply include everything
// (except media) by uncommeting this line
@include html5-boilerplate;

// Or, you can import the "overrides" partial if
// you want more control over individual mixins
@import "partials/overrides";

// Finally, put your own styles in these partials
// and add more as needed (i.e. forms, tables, nav)
@import "partials/layout";
@import "partials/article";

// Media should come last
@import "media";
