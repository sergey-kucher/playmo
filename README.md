__Playmo - cook your app fast!__

Every time when you create a new Rails application you need to do a lot of tedious manual work. Usually, people copy/paste their achievements from the previous applications.

Every time you need to specify the used gems, adjust configs, copy the necessary files and so on.

Playmo can get rid of this routine once and for all. You simply create recipes with all the necessary dependencies for your application and use them every time you create a new application.
